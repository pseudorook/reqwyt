\employerandjobtitle{Whoop-ass Canning Company}{Assembly Line Manager}
\whenandwhere{431 BC}{371 BC}{Spárti, Laconia} \\
I managed a team of sixty assembly line workers at a factory where we
processed, manufactured, and distributed cans of whoop-ass --- and also olive
oil --- for export, mostly to elementary schools in Newfoundland. During my
tenure, my specific responsibilities included: \\
\vspace{0.5ex}
\hangindent=1ex \ --- Taking names and \textit{then} kicking ass, \\
\hangindent=1ex \ --- Busting ass, \\
\hangindent=1ex \ --- Hauling ass, and \\
\hangindent=1ex \ --- Putting my ass on the line. \\

\employerandjobtitle{Cookie Cutter Corporation}{\textit{De facto} IT}
\whenandwhere{Jan 1971}{The End of Time}{Apple Pie, USA} \\
At the behest of my co-workers, I demonstrated my marginal but above average
computer prowess by fixing their trivial problems. Setting up their Wi-Fi,
connecting them to the printer, purging antivirus software downloaded from
banner ads --- I did it all. And how naïve I was. Before long, I became
\textit{it}. The unwitting IT sap who is tacitly expected by everyone to fix
their computers and solve their problems. Soon, what I had done as a favor to a
few people became an inextricable part of my job. A job with no end, no escape.

\topic{GitHub Project Nobody's Seen or Used No. 1}
\whenandwhere{Apr 2011}{Today}{My Life} \\
I wrote a not-insubstantial program that implements something that I do often
enough that taking the time and effort to automate it is (barely) worthwhile
but so tailored to my idiosyncratic needs to be rendered completely useless to
the world at large.
\sectionsep%

\topic{GitHub Project Nobody's Seen or Used No. 2}
\whenandwhere{Apr 2011}{Today}{My Life} \\
I forked a popular repository so that I could tweak some of the source code to
my satifaction. These changes will not at some future point be merged back
upstream, though. As I have no intention of contributing to the main project or
keeping up with upstream development, this code will languish unused and
abandoned.
